            <h1>Edikan's Jollof Rice Recipe</h1>
            <p>
                This is a foolproof recipe for cooking the best Jollof rice ever.Jollof rice is West Africa’s most
                popular dish and with this amazing recipe all Jollof battles come to an end this recipe as been passed
                down in the family for generations and has been passed down from the when the first ever Jollof was made
                but now with a modern twist to it. I like to serve it as a side with my West African-style grilled beef
                (Suya), but it can also be a main course.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Combine tomato, red bell pepper, garlic, ginger, and water in a blender for the sauce. Blend on
                        high until smooth and set aside.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt and sauté until onion starts
                        to soften, <em>4 to 5 minutes</em>. Clear space in the middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and
                        sauté for <em>2 to 3 minutes</em>. Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, thyme, pepper, and
                        turmeric; continue cooking for <em>1 to 2 minutes</em> until everything is well combined.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Turn off the heat, and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of rice is coated with the
                        oil-tomato mixture. Add bay leaf and chicken bouillon paste.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Turn heat to high, stir in tomato sauce, and bring to a vigorous simmer. Cover with a tight
                        fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for <em>20 minutes</em>. Do not remove the
                        lid or stir rice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Turn off heat after <em>20 minutes</em>, and set the timer for <em>12 minutes</em>. Allow rice
                        to sit and do not remove the lid.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After the <em>12 minutes</em> are up, remove lid, and fluff rice with a fork, separating all the grains.
                        Serve garnished with green onions and chopped cilantro.
                    </li>

                <p>
                    If rice seems to be a little undercooked at this point, stop fluffing. Pat the rice down gently with
                    the back of the fork, cover tightly again, and set heat to medium low. Cook for another <mark>5 minutes</mark>,
                    and check again.
